# BusbyHAskingQuestions



The user is asked questions and the user has to input their responses.

Program uses while loops and data validation to create it.

The program asks the user for their name and the time they woke up. The program functions as intended, taking in both inputs and typing them out into a sentence. The game allows you to replay it as well. Including the data validation would help so that the user doesn't input an answer that doesn't satisfy the question being asked. Other than that the program is good, and I like how closing the program prompts it to tell you to go away! nice job!
